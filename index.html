                        <p>Acer Inc. is a multinational hardware and electronics corporation, specializing in advanced electronics technology, headquartered in Xizhi, Taiwan. Acer's products include desktop PCs, laptop PCs, tablets and peripherals.</p>
                        <p>Acer may be better known for affordable consumer laptops than business-class systems, but the company does offer enticing options for workers. The lineup includes laptops that are slim and portable, laptops meant for serious multitasking, and flexible 2-in-1s. Even better, many of our top picks for work are quite affordable, but keep in mind that they are primarily consumer laptops, these weren't built to be used 9-plus hours a day for years at a time, and many of them have unnecessary bloatware. Users with personal needs and a modest budget would do well to consider an Acer.</p>
